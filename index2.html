  	<h2> I forgot to do my homework </h2>
  	<p> The picture of the man who is about to fall down from steep represents myself. Since I have really high expectation of myself, I get disappointed in myself if I do something wrong. I'm very extreme and sensitive about what I'm doing and how I get reflected to other people. I chose the subject homework because people can easily recognize that I'm being way extreme about forgetting to do homework, which is not a big issue. </p>

    <h2> Poker </h2>
    <p> The project was created during the class in an hour. There are two different sides of myself. One is getting bored and sleepy when I'm reading the book. The other one is I get excited and stay awake when I play poker. It reveals my obsession of poker. "A" represents awake and "b" represents bored in the card. Moreover, by putting myself into a poker card, it emphasizes that I'm a part of the game. It shows that I'm "into" poker.
