    <h2> My brother is a terminator. </h2>
    <p> My brother always wanted to be a terminator. My brother and I watched Terminator 2: Judgement day a lot when were kids. We used to have a video, which was dubbed in Korean and it was the only video we used to watch. He always imitated as a terminator since he loves him. Even nowadays, sometimes he doesn't smile like a terminator. He wanted to be a terminator. This is the illustration work that I made for him.</p>

    <h2> Reaction of the Gift </h2>
    	<P> He was surprised first when I sent him the picture. He said, "Hahaha, this is funny but you should upload this in facebook only for us to see. You should have chosen a better picture." He liked it but he think it's too serious. Well, but if you want to be a terminator, you have to be serious.</P>
